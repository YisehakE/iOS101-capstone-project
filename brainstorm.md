## Favorite Existing Apps - Categorize and Evaluate
### Beli
   - **Category:** Social / Food
   - **Mobile:** Only available on mobile (iOS & AND)
   - **Story:** Allows users to track and rate eateries they have been to or wish to dine at in a fun, social-media fashion.
   - **Market:** Anyone who enjoys food and discussing it (i.e foodies). Clean interface and profile allows those who wish to organize & list places they've been to easily.
   - **Habit:** Users can post or privately bookmark dining spots at anytime, making it addictive on top of the fact you can view other people's most or least favorite spots. The rating feature is game-ified in the sense Beli forces you to compare a new spot you enter  with prev. restaurants you've been to in the same category (e.g cafe, bakery/desserts, etc). 
   - **Scope:** Started off basic with posting and viewing-feed capabilities, to now incorporating premium features as well as personal recommendation algorithms.
### Robinhood
   - **Category: Finance
   - **Mobile:** Available on mobile (iOS & AND) and via website.
   - **Story:** Allows users to buy & sell stocks through a online brokerage.
   - **Market:** Anyone - from novice to professional who has a bank account and a SSN. Truly a revolutionary app that broke the obsure barrier to investing.
   - **Habit:** Allows users to trade stocks at any time with trading hours (exception: cryptos being 24x7). Highly addictive to continously check dashboard throughout the day, especially considering the fact that people have a high incentive to since their money are at stake.
   - **Scope:** Started off as a simple UI/UX for brokerage needs, and transformed into a E2E application supporting banking, investing, retirement, and financial news features.
